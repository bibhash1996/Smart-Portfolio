          When I&apos;m not immersed in lines of code, you can find me at the
          gym, where I enjoy working out and pushing my physical limits. Fitness
          is an essential part of my life, as it keeps me energized and focused.
          I also have a deep appreciation for travel, exploring the diverse
          beauty of India. From the serene beaches of Goa to the majestic
          mountains of Himachal Pradesh, I relish experiencing new cultures,
          cuisines, and landscapes. Whether it&apos;s hiking in the hills or
          discovering hidden gems in bustling cities, I believe that every
          journey enriches my perspective and inspires my creativity. Feel free
          to modify any part of this introduction to better suit your style!
        </p>
        <p>I&apos;m also very much into self-improvement and nutrition.</p>
